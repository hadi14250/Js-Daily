# decrypt

A function that decrypts an encrypted passcode generated by the [`encrypt`](../encrypt/) function. It reverses the encryption process and returns the original 9-character passcode. If the input doesn't meet the decryption requirements, the function returns `"WRONG PASSCODE TO DECRYPT"`.

## Decryption Process

1. The encrypted passcode is a 9 to 11 character string consisting of three parts:
   - The first three characters (Part 2 from the encryption) are reversed.
   - The next three characters (Part 3 from the encryption) are shifted back to their original letters.
   - The final 3-5 characters (Part 1 from the encryption) include alphabet positions and an unchanged middle character, which are converted back to their original letters.

2. The decryption process reconstructs the original passcode by reversing these transformations:
   - **Part 1 (final 3-5 characters)**: Converts numbers back to letters and places them in their original positions.
   - **Part 2 (first three characters)**: Reverses the order to restore the middle part of the original string.
   - **Part 3 (next three characters)**: Shifts letters back by one position, converting `'a'` to `'z'` and so on.

If the decryption process results in an invalid passcode, it returns `"WRONG PASSCODE TO DECRYPT"`.

## Output Example

### Example 1:
Input: `"bsepoe10a13"`  
Output: `"jamesbond"`

### Example 2:
Input: `"invalidpasscode"`  
Output: `"WRONG PASSCODE TO DECRYPT"`

## Code Explanation

1. **Input validation**: The function first checks if the decrypted passcode meets the original conditions (9 lowercase letters). If not, it returns `"WRONG PASSCODE TO DECRYPT"`.

2. **Decrypting the string**: The encrypted string is split into three parts and transformed back:
   - Part 1: Converts alphabetic positions back into letters.
   - Part 2: Reverses the first three characters to restore the middle part of the original passcode.
   - Part 3: Shifts letters back by one position.

3. **Return the final result**: The function returns the reconstructed original passcode.

### Example Usage

```javascript
import { encrypt } from "../encrypt/encrypt.js";

function isLowerAlpha(str) {
  return [...str].every((char) => char >= "a" && char <= "z");
}

function decrypt(encryptedPasscode) {
  let arr1,
    arr2,
    arr3,
    match = "";

  match = encryptedPasscode.slice(6).match(/(\d+)([a-zA-Z])(\d+)/);

  arr1 =
    String.fromCharCode(Number(match[1]) + 96) +
    match[2] +
    String.fromCharCode(Number(match[3]) + 96);

  arr2 = [...encryptedPasscode.substr(0, 3)].reverse().join("");
  arr3 = [...encryptedPasscode.substr(3, 3)]
    .map((char) => (char === "a" ? "z" : String.fromCharCode(char.charCodeAt(0) - 1)))
    .join("");

  const passcode = arr1 + arr2 + arr3;
  if (passcode.length !== 9 || !isLowerAlpha(passcode))
    return "WRONG PASSCODE TO DECRYPT";
  return passcode;
}

console.log("Encrypting jamesbond turned into:", encrypt("jamesbond"));
console.log("Decrypting bsepoe10a13 turned into:", decrypt(encrypt("jamesbond")));
